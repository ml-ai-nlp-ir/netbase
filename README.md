** Netbase -- Semantic Graph Database **

Netbase, your semantic web database. 
Knowledge Graph containing over 600,000,000 nodes and statements, 
from all the Internet's finest sources, 
including Freebase, [WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q54837), DBPedia, Yago, Wordnet, babelnet, ... 
as well as many custom GraphDBs. 

From simple entities to complex queries, this is by far the fastest db of its kind.

Netbase is much more than a hyperfast triple store: it has the work net ontology and it's relation built-in, so that you can quickly query with synonyms, transitive class hierarchies and part meronyms.

For example instead of asking about Barack Obamas daughters you could just search for Obamas todlers.
